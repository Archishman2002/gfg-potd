### Que - Number of 1 Bits

[Question Link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/set-bits0143/1)


### My approaches
Since this question is relatively simple and can be solved in multiple ways, I would like to present two commonly used approaches.

#### Approach 1:
The first approach involves iterating through the bits of the binary representation of the number and counting the set bits. Here how it works:

   - We repeatedly `right-shift` the number by `1 bit` and add the `rightmost` bit to the counter variable `cnt` if it is `1` counter increased . If the bit is `0`, the counter remains unchanged.
   
**Example:**
   ```cpp
   if [n = 18 (10010)]
   - 10010     , cnt = 0
   - 1001      , cnt = 1
   - 100       , cnt = 1
   - 10        , cnt = 1
   - 1         , cnt = 2
   ```

- **Time complexity:** `O(log(n))`, as we iterate through all the bits of `n`, which totals to `log(n`).
- **Space complexity:** `O(1)`

#### Code (C++):
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int setBits(int n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while(n){
            cnt += n & 1;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

#### Approach 2:
The second approach utilizes the standard library function `__builtin_popcount(n)` in C++ to count the number of set bits. This approach involves a concise one-liner code using the built-in function.

#### Code (C++):
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int setBits(int n) {
        return __builtin_popcount(n);
    }
};
```

- **Time complexity:** `O(k)`, where k is the number of bits.
- **Space complexity:** `O(1)`
