# GFG Problem Of The Day

## Today - 28 June 2023
### Que - Maximum Depth Of Binary Tree

[Question Link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/1)


### My approach
- I use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse all levels of the tree.
- By incrementing a `height` variable during each level traversal, I am able to keep track of the number of levels in the tree. 
- Since BFS visits all levels of the tree, the count of levels represents the maximum height of the tree that we require.

### Code (c++) 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(Node* root) {
        int height = 0;
        queue<Node*> q;
        q.push(root);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int sz = q.size();
            ++height;
            
            while (sz--) {
                auto frontNode = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                if (frontNode->left)
                    q.push(frontNode->left);
                if (frontNode->right)
                    q.push(frontNode->right);
            }
        }
        
        return height;
    }
};
```
