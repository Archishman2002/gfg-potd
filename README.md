## GFG Problem Of The Day

### Today - 27 September 2023
### Que - Find the closest pair from two arrays

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-closest-pair-from-two-arrays4215/1)

### Issue in problem || test cases
It appears there is some confusion either in the problem description or in what they expect as the correct output. Additionally, I believe there might be issues with the expected values for their test cases. My code only passed 5 out of 1120 test cases upon submission.

I'm awaiting for the correction of the problem statement or an update to the test cases.
