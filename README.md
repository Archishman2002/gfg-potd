### My Approach
This problem is an improvised version of the target sum problem, and I approached it using a recursive method with memoization (DP) to explore all possible coin combinations. 
Here are the steps to do so:
- The recursive function `solve` is used, taking parameters such as the current index `i`,`n`, the current sum `sum`, `coins`, and a vector `dp` to store intermediate results.
- The function checks if the current sum is a valid solution (2024 or divisible by 20 or 24), returning true if so.
- Base cases are set: if the index exceeds the number of coins or the sum surpasses 2024, it returns false.
- At each index, two conditions are considered: 'take' or 'not take.' Two recursive calls are made 
	- One for 'not take,' where the index is increased with the same sum.
	- The other is for 'take,' where both the sum and index are incremented. 
	- These recursive calls evaluate all cases, returning true or false. 
- Memoization is used at every step to reduce redundant computations.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * sum)`, where n is the number of coins and sum is the target sum
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: `O(n * sum)` due to the memoization table.

### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool solve(int i, int& n, int sum, int coins[], vector<unordered_map<int,bool>>& dp){
        if(sum == 2024 || (sum && (sum%20 == 0 || sum%24 == 0)))
            return true;
        
        if(i == n || sum > 2024)
            return false;
        
        if(dp[i].find(sum) != dp[i].end())
            return dp[i][sum];
        
        int nt = solve(i+1, n, sum, coins, dp);
        if(nt)
            return dp[i][sum] = nt;
        
        return dp[i][sum] = solve(i+1, n, sum + coins[i], coins, dp);
    }
    
    int isPossible(int n , int coins[]) 
    {
        vector<unordered_map<int,bool>> dp(n);
        return solve(0,n,0,coins, dp);
    }
};
```
