## 18. Sum of leaf nodes in BST
The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-leaf-nodes-in-bst/1)

### My Approach
- If the root is null, it returns 0.
- If the root has no left and right children (i.e., it's a leaf node), it returns the value of that node.
- Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on the left and right subtrees and returns the sum of the results.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity** : `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the Binary Search Tree.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity** : `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the Binary Search Tree.

### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumOfLeafNodes(Node *root) {
        if (!root)
            return 0;
        
        if (!root->left && !root->right)
            return root->data;
        
        return sumOfLeafNodes(root->left) + sumOfLeafNodes(root->right);
    }
};
```
